## About me

**Aspiring frontend developer with 12 years of experience in digital marketing.**

Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in content creation, SEO, user experience, and website project management, all of which have sparked my passion for building intuitive, user-centric web applications.

My journey into frontend development began as a personal challenge. I aimed to become an equal partner in communication with programmers. However, the deeper I delved into frontend development, the clearer it became to me that this was the right path for me.

Now, after two years of study and working on my own projects, I can confidently say that I am ready for a role as a junior frontend developer. I believe that my experience from the other side of the table can bring more customer understanding to a team, as well as a fresh perspective.

My flagship project is Mamakoduje.cz, a personal blog built with React Vite, Firebase database and Cloudinary storage. This blog serves as a space to share my experiences as a self-taught developer and a mother, detailing my learning process, course reviews, and the ups and downs of balancing motherhood with career growth.

You can check out the project on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/katykola/mama-koduje) or visit the live blog [here](https://mamakoduje-cc7d1.web.app/).

# Hey! 🦩 I’m Katy Kolarova

## About me

**Aspiring frontend developer with 12 years of experience in digital marketing.**

Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in content creation, SEO, and user experience, all of which have sparked my passion for building intuitive, user-centric web applications. My journey into frontend development began as a personal challenge, transitioning from digital marketing to coding, and I’m excited to combine my background with my new technical skills.

One of my flagship projects is Máma kóduje, a personal blog built with React and Vite. This blog serves as a space to share my experiences as a self-taught developer and a mother, detailing my learning process, course reviews, and the ups and downs of balancing motherhood with career growth.

The Máma kóduje blog uses a modern tech stack, including:

- **React and Vite** for fast, dynamic front-end development
-**Firebase Firestore** for storing and managing blog content in real time
-**Firebase Authentication** for securing the admin section and allowing easy user management
-**Cloudinary** for storing and optimizing images to ensure fast load times and high-quality visuals
  
You can check out the project on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/katykola/mama-koduje) or visit the live blog [here](https://mamakoduje-cc7d1.web.app/).

## About me

**Aspiring frontend developer with 12 years of experience in digital marketing.**

Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in content creation, SEO, and user experience, all of which have sparked my passion for building intuitive, user-centric web applications. My journey into frontend development began as a personal challenge, transitioning from digital marketing to coding, and Iâ€™m excited to combine my background with my new technical skills.

One of my flagship projects is MÃ¡ma kÃ³duje, a personal blog built with React and Vite. This blog serves as a space to share my experiences as a self-taught developer and a mother, detailing my learning process, course reviews, and the ups and downs of balancing motherhood with career growth.

The MÃ¡ma kÃ³duje blog uses a modern tech stack, including:

- **React and Vite** for fast, dynamic front-end development
-**Firebase Firestore** for storing and managing blog content in real time
-**Firebase Authentication** for securing the admin section and allowing easy user management
-**Cloudinary** for storing and optimizing images to ensure fast load times and high-quality visuals

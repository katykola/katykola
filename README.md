# ðŸ¦© Hola, I'm Katy Kolarova and I'm so glad we finally met each other! ðŸŒ· 

Aspiring frontend developer with 12 years of experience in digital marketing. Proficient in HTML, CSS, SCSS, SASS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB, and currently expanding my skills in React. Iâ€™m highly motivated, with strong communication abilities and a track record of working directly with clients on web app projects. Experienced in both collaborative team roles and leadership positions, Iâ€™ve worked closely with designers, developers, and project managers to deliver successful projects.
